### Description
This project is intended to be the backend for a basic social network api. It provides users with a place to make new friends online, or to connect with their friends and family online. The main challenge I faced was getting the reactions rouates to work, as I would up running out of time to do so.

### Installation
As this is only the backend, you would need node, insomnia, and the code in order to run it.

### Usage
You would use this project to post your thoughts online, add new friends, and see the thoughts of others. Please view the [demo video](https://youtu.be/Nmbc04KUZGM)

### Credits
I had some assistance in starting the routes from my tutor Corey Yates.

### Features
You can create/delete a user. You can add/remove friends, and you can add/remove thoughts.

### Future Development
In the future I would like to complete the reactions routes and add update routes to both thoughts and users.
